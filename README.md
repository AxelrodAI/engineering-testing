# Engineering Testing Lab 🧪

An autonomous, self-improving agentic software development laboratory.

## Purpose

This repo is a living experiment in **perfecting agentic software development**. An AI agent continuously:

1. **Builds** — picks a challenge, writes code, tests it
2. **Measures** — tracks quality metrics (test pass rate, bugs found, time-to-working)
3. **Learns** — logs what worked, what failed, updates its own process
4. **Improves** — each iteration refines the development process itself

## Structure

## Philosophy

> "Every iteration should leave the process measurably better than it found it."

The agent doesn't just write code — it writes *better ways to write code*, then proves it with data.
